POC for django channels and react websockets.

# Run locally
To run the app locally run `docker-compose up` in the project root. This will bring the `redis` and `jerry` containers up.

Navigate to the `frontend/` and run `npm run build` to build the static resources.

Should be ready by now.

Ps: You might need to change some url configs in some js files manually. Also this app was build in a hurry so please do not judge the code quality.
